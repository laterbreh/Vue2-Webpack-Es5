# Vue2-Webpack-Es5
My attempt with Vue 2.0, Webpack, and using ES5. 

I did not attempt to set this up with ES6, as I am still learning Vue, and the documentation is in ES5. I decided to give webpack a go, and integrate Jquery, and use it inside of the methods of Vue just to see if it works. 

This is just some sample code to get you going if you are interested in playing with vue using webpack, and also to still have access to our ever so beloved jQuery. 

`npm install`
